## Compiled vs Interpreted

Generally speaking programming languages may be divides into two categories:

- Compiled languages; and
- Interpreted languages.

A good part of programming languages may have compiled implementations and be interpreted (the language itself isn't necessary compiled or interpreted). But, for terms of simplicity, they are referred this way.
For instance, a food recipe in ancient Greek, in case you do not understand ancient Greek, there are two ways to follow the recipe steps:

1. In case someone have already translated to your language. You (and anyone who understand you language) may read the translated version of the recipe. Think about this version as the compiled version;
2. The other way is having a friend that already understand the ancient Greek version. When you are ready to make the food, this friend will translate and tell the recipe for you. In this case, the friend is the interpreter for interpreted recipe version.
