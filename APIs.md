# API (Application Programming Interface)

The acronym API stands for Application Programming Interface, and it is an intermediary software that allows two applications to talk to each other. Every time you use an application like Facebook, send a message, or check the weather, you are using an API.  
The API is not the database or even the server; it is the code that governs the access points to the server.  
An example is ordering food at a restaurant. The customer orders their food from the waiter. But what happens between ordering the pizza and receiving it?  
APIs, that's what happens! The waiter talks to the cook (other services and databases) to prepare the order. Finally, with the order ready, the cook gives the order to the waiter and it is delivered to the table.
